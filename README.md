# Digital-diary
This is a web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. This application can be used as an alternative for traditional diary. One can signup, login, create and save remainders, add notes and details of people, store personal details, upload photos, send mail, export records etc.  
These forms are used to add the records to the database.

I built this in my localhost.
You may run this file in Xamp or Wamp server.
